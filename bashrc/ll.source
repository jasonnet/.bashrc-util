# ubuntu has 
#   alias='ls -alF' in .bashrc by default.
#
# cygwin has a commented out in its .bashrc
#   alias='ls -l' 
#
# So let's go with the ubuntu version: 
alias ll='ls -alF'


# And let's also support our favorite (long with most recent at end):
alias lsltr='ls -lt'
# With this defined, I can quickly invoke it with:   lsl<tab>
#     and if I try that it and it doesn't complete, I know that I don't have that installed.
